Terraform automation build for AWS services. We need following components.
  - Java JDK/JRE - 8
  - Jenkins
  - Terraform

### Installation

I have followed [website][PlDb] for making my jenkins installation.

```sh
$ cd /tmp && wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
$ echo 'deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install jenkins
```

Next I have installed terraform  [official website][PlGh]

```sh
$ wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.11.8/terraform_0.11.8_linux_amd64.zip
$ sudo apt-get install unzip
$ unzip terraform_0.11.1_linux_amd64.zip 
$ sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/
````
I have made 2 appraches separately 

- For each commit make some terraform actions
- Maual invocation of terraform script according to the environment variables

First Approach:

 - Open jenkins select on create new item
 - Select job type as multibranch pipeline
 - Add your git repo , username and password or how ever you want to access your project
 - Select the interval to which it needs to poll
 - Save the project 
 
 You're ready with your job which does polling based on commits and does the processing 

Second Approach:
- Create a new pipeline job
- Add a parameter accepting variable which environment options using choice parameter
- Add a new pipeline script
- The script executes terraform commands by using the envionment variables using user_input

This is a controlled way for doing the job.

The job configuration for the jenkins are given in the jobs folder of the repo
